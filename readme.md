## Plugin Setup
1. Find an appropriate [plugin-slug](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) according to the solution of the plugin.
2. Write the 4-5 character prefix, plugin name, short and long descriptions, keywords, block name, and block description in a temporary notebook.
2. If your block is not part of `b-blocks`, then the text domain should be your `plugin-slug`.
4. Apply 1st and 2nd list data to this template with case sensitivity: uppercase for uppercase, lowercase for lowercase, title case for title case, and camel case for camel case.
5. Complete the `readme.txt` file.
6. The main element is `.wp-block-b-blocks-{blockname}`, and its immediate child is `.bBlocksBlockName`. Do not apply width or columns for the main element.
7. Write appropriate class and ID names for the elements.
8. Add the initial roadmap for the plugin in the `todo.txt`.
9. If you skip one of these, we will not provide any support for the project.
10. Enjoy CODING!

The folder structure that `plugin-zip` accepts is:

```
/plugin-name
	plugin-name.php
	uninstall.php
	/languages
	/includes
	/admin
		/js
		/css
		/images
	/public
		/js
		/css
		/images
```

**If you want to add custom folders, you have to add those folder names to the {files} array in the `package.json` file.**
